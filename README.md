This simulation was just written to simulate one cluster detector of the
miniball type in the Heidelberg experiment "Bremsstrahlung im alpha Zerfall".

It is NOT meant to be a simulation of the miniball detector array, though I
tried to keep it as open as possible.

It is still a pre-beta version, lots of features are not even tested well 
and there are lots of things to do and lots of bugs to fix.

There is no proper documentation and there are hardly any comments in the code.
I tried to write some HowTo-files, which will hopefully be a bit of a help 
(please excuse my poor English). I am sorry, but i cannot give support!

I would like to invite everyone, who wants to use the package to contribute
to the programming. The files are available on CVS, just contact me to get
access.

There is also a forum on the Internet, where i would like you to contribute
major changes, ideas, fixed bugs, problems, ...
