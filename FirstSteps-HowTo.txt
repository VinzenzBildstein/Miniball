This HowTo describes the first steps to get a simulation running.

1) Compiling the library
------------------------

Either you use your own Geant4 installation or you use the Geant4 installation
on the Heidelberg MPI-K computer cluster.

For the Geant4 installation on the MPI-K computer cluster you should use
the two scripts provided to set all environment variables:

	. /cern/geant4/Geant4.rc
	. /cern/geant4/Root.rc

(This system is compiled with gcc 3.2.3 which is the recommended 
compiler version)

Now enter the g4miniball directory and just type

   	make
or      make mblib

This creates the MiniBall-library in the MBLIB directory (by default ./lib)


2) Compiling the example simulation
-----------------------------------

In the "examples" directory you find example simulations.

Enter the directory of a example simulation, e.g. "Ex01" and type 

  make

(type "make examples" in the g4miniball directory to compile all
examples)

An binary Ex01 will be created in the G4BIN directory. Execute this 
binary to start the example simulation.

If you start the simulation you will get a prompt:

   Idle>

To start the event generation and the tracking use the following command

   Idle>/run/beamOn 1000000

where the parameter is the number of events to be generated.
The Ex01 simulation generates one triple cluster and an isotropic source.
The output is a root-file called "miniball.root" containing several histograms
and a root-tree.

The are different ways to get a visualization of the scene. For an example
use one of the included macros: 

    Idle>/control/execute OGLS_vis.mac

You can change the point of view by

    Idle>/vis/viewer/set/viewpointThetaPhi <theta> <phi>

and the position of the lights by

    Idle>/vis/viewer/set/lightsThetaPhi <theta> <phi>

For more details please see http://geant4.web.cern.ch


3) Examples
-----------

The provided examples show how to use the package. 

Ex01:	a simple triple cluster with an isotropic source.

Ex02:	several triple clusters placed in a DetectorConstruction class

Ex03:	example for a setup created by the MiniBallDetectorArray class

Ex04:	example for integration of a user defined detector in a
        miniball setup

Good luck
